### Inspirations:
The inspiration of "tree" tool came from "garland" tool, the inspiration of "oil" tool came from an art app called Procreate which help people paint. And the "epiphany" tool generated by  accident. 
### What I was going for:
My aim is to draw on a white canvas with "oil", "tree" and "epiphany" tools.

### What each tool does (and how to use it):
 #### Oil ‚û°Ô∏è: Slowly drag the mouse to draw and draw like the oil painting lines.
 #### Tree üå≤ : Drag the mouse to randomly put some trees and vegetables on the canvas.
 #### Epiphany ü§î : Drag the mouse and the background color of the canvas will become dark, at the same time draw some Oblique lines.
 #### The first button ‚≠ïÔ∏è: pressing the button could clear the whole canvas.

### One related thought from the reading:
Thanks for the technical support from https://p5js.org/learn/curves.html
