### Inspirations:

Originally wanted to make a small cartoon people, accidentally made octopus.

### What is your generative space? (ie, what kinds of things can this generate?)

Mine generates a group of octopus with different height and different emotions.

### What do each of the sliders do?

#### height: Adjust the height of each octopus
#### color: Changes the color of each octopus
#### headSize: Adjust the size of each octopus' head
#### bounce speed: Changes the bounce speed of the octopus
#### strokeWeight: Adjust the size of each octopus' eyes
#### mouthShape: Adjust the shape of each octopus' mouth

### One related thought from the reading:

Let me feel the beauty of random number, it can be so magically used in various fields.
